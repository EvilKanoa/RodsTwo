LightningRods 2
=================================
LightningRods 2 is a new and (greatly) improved version of my plugin [LightningRod] (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/kanoas-lightning-rods) which is a plugin that adds magic wands (ish) that can preform things.  LightningRods 2 comes with every feature of the previous version, plus so much much more! 

Requirments
-----------
 - Vault (**optional**) - If you want to use the signs to sell rods, you need this.

Features

 - Auto generated config, no need to worry about things like these: "This is a big update, delete your config before running".
 - A large assortment of interesting and (some) original rods.
 - A simple way for admins to spawn rods with a GUI.
 - Signs to sell rods (intergrated with Vault)
 - Permissions for using every rod.
